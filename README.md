<!-- Introduction ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# Introduction:
This is a landing page that requires users to login or register in order to proceed using standard HTML, CSS, and a small JavaScript file (to assist with the toggle switch from Login to Register). This project inspiration came from Easy Tutorials on YouTube (url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5WWrGMsnpw). I included a few more form ID element code line to the Register section vs what the content creator had on his video. Icons are hyperlink to their own social media home pages. Registeration form does not save data at this time as a new project will need to be created for that form and linked back to this project.

## Motivation
I am starting week 1 of my Front End Software Development boot camp program at <a href="https://www.promineotech.com/">Promineo Tech</a>. We will be focusing on JavaScript for the next few weeks. I worked ahead on this week's material and wanted to challenge myself to build a simple Login and Registration form.  I came across a tutorial on YouTube that caught my attention due to the UI appearance. I wanted something that looked pleasant to the user and not simple or plain; this content creator provided me with that while keeping the tutorial under 20 minutes.
