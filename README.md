# Project's Title: Login-form
This is a landing page that requires users to login or register in order to proceed.


Project inspiration came from Easy Tutorials on YouTube (url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5WWrGMsnpw)
This project includes HTML, CSS, and a small JavaScript file (to assist with the toggle switch from Login to Register).
I did include a few more form ID element code line to the Register section vs what the content creator had on his video.
