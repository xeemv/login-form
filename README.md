# login-form
Project inspiration came from Easy Tutorials on YouTube (url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5WWrGMsnpw)
This project includes HTML, CSS, and a small JavaScript file (to assist with the toggle switch from Login to Register)
I did include a few more form ID element code line to the Register section vs what the content creator had on his video.
